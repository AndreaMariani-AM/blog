Sup! Happy you've stumbled upon this blog, bear with me and come along for the ride as I introduce to you my very ordinary life and the reason why I've decided to open this blog. First things first, my name's Andrea, Italian boy by birth, I've studied Pharmacy in Italy and worked for a bit in Helsinki (y'all need to check out that place, seriously stunning). In Helsinki, I came in contact, for the first time, with the bioinformatics/computational biology field when I was working on data from RNA-seq experiments and thought "this is it, I like this stuff".  Btw, when I came back I've kinda felt out of place, or at least not exactly sure about where I was headed, professionally speaking. So, during that desperate time (jk), an e-mail from a friend came in like a blessing. It was about the enrollment for a Master of second-level (and if you're not from Italy that might sound odd and probably doesn't make any sense, long story short it's an MSc degree you can do if you already hold an MSc.) in Genomic Data Science. Again I thought, "this is it, I like this stuff". And that's about the reason why I'm here; I thought it'd be helpful, mostly for me, to track down what I'm studying/learning and applying it straight away with this web blog. I guess the end goal with all of this, is to show the highest highs and the lowest lows of data science. And I'm not gonna lie, it's also a way to get noticed by people (recruiters reading this, wink-wink). 
Lastly, don't take this too seriously, this won't be "the ultimate super detailed guide to solve your data science problems". I'll try to approach this by summarizing key features of what I'm learning and presenting them in an organized and logical way, linking relevant articles for the more technical side. That's it, see ya.

This is where I plug all my social media, right? It's ok if I sell myself mom?
