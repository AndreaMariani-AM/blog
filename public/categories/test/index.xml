      <description>My Guilty Pleasure This post&amp;rsquo;s gonna be a little bit different. I wanted to share one of my biggest guilty pleasures, and that is watching videos from 3Blue1Brown, specifically nerdy videos about numbers and maths. I have never been a huge fan of these topics, to be honest, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found out that watching his videos is kinda intriguing, and ofc very informative.
For those of you that ignore who 3Blue1Brown is, his namesâ€™ Grant Sanderson, and has a youtube channel where it combines math and entertainment.</description>

      <description>First of all, What&amp;rsquo;s this? This is the program I&amp;rsquo;m enrolled in atm and as of today it&amp;rsquo;s still named &amp;ldquo;Secondary Level Master&amp;rsquo;s Degree&amp;rdquo;. Wait, let&amp;rsquo;s cut the chase right out, the heck is this? For all the non-Italians out there, this needs a bit of an explanation and context. To be completely honest, I&amp;rsquo;m not aware if something similar even exists outside of this country.
Anyways, Italian&amp;rsquo;s higher education is roughly structured as follows:</description>

      <description>Although it may seem that I&amp;rsquo;m referring to the current COVID-19 situation, this is actually a post on how I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to ruin my life once and for all, with everything I&amp;rsquo;d like to know by the end of the year. Seems like a heck of a long shot now that I&amp;rsquo;m reading this again, but let this boy dream. Below some stuff I&amp;rsquo;m studying now and something that&amp;rsquo;s planned for the future.</description>

      <title>Setting Up The Blog</title>

      <description>All right, let&amp;rsquo;s cut to the chase, creating this Blog with RStudio, blogdown, and Hugo themes after just a week of introduction to R programming for my MSc&amp;rsquo;s program, was hella hard and a pain in the butt. I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna lie.
Most of the tutorials/how-to that you can find online, be it on video format or another person&amp;rsquo;s blog, are absolutely great; for them and for their settings and probably won&amp;rsquo;t transfer as well as you might think in your specific case.</description>
