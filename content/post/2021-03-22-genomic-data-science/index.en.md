# First of all, What's this?
This is the program I'm enrolled in atm and as of today it's still named  "Secondary Level Master's Degree".
Wait, let's cut the chase right out, the heck is this?
For all the non-Italians out there, this needs a bit of an explanation and context. To be completely honest, I'm not aware if something similar even exists outside of this country.  

Anyways, Italian's higher education is roughly structured as follows:

1. Bachelor's degree (3 years)
2. Master's degree( 2 years)
3. Full-on 5/6 years degrees (like medicine or law, for example)  

This is considered as a "first-level", or something like that, it's quite foggy though. After this, you can take on one of these paths:

1. PhD
2. School of specialization
3. First level Master's degree
4. Second level Master's degree  

And here is where it gets tricky 'cause these degrees have the same exact name as the Master that follows a bachelor. 
To make this as simple as possible, a first-level Master's degree is a Master that can be attended by bachelor students (undergrads), while a second-level Master's is a Master's that can be attended by Master's students (post-bachelor, grad student).  


I know this is hella confusing but bear with me for a second. The idea underlying this structure is that these first/second-level Masters should bridge the gap between Universities and companies, giving the possibility to students to specialize in a sector and also gain work experience while doing it. Then what are schools of specialization, you might ask. Honestly, I have no clues.

## What's the Structure Like
How's structured then? Well, it blends courses/modules and independent study spread over two years. It's not as grade-centric as BSc or MSc are, but it does test you. In these two years, you're also expected to do an internship on a subject that's specific to the course, and the ultimate goal, in my case, is to produce a relevant thesis and hopefully a decent publication.  

It has 5 modules per year for two years plus some conferences and seminars throughout the whole year. Those will be more field-specific and organized within the student's interests. 


## Modules and Courses
As said before, it's divided into 5 modules per year and this's a brief overview of the modules.

### First year

1. Statistics with R. Ofc starts off with an introduction of classical statistical inference (parametric and non-parametric statistics), data visualization in R, and a general introduction to R programming language and RStudio.  

2. Regression Models. It comprises linear and logistic regression, linear mixed models, and survival analysis.  

3. Resampling Methods. Covers a variety of topics like permutation/bootstrapping and randomization, Monte Carlo simulation, FDR, and empirical p-values.  

4. Epidemiology Applied to Genetics. Covers the design and the interpretation of various epidemiological studies.  

5. Statistics applied to Genetics. It's all about them Genome-Wide (GW) studies.  

 

### Second year

1. Handling and Analysis of Big Data. Cloud and parallel computing,  use of databases (SQL and NoSQL), and introduction to Python programming.  

2. Bioinformatics Applied to Genetics. I'm so waiting for this. Next-gen seq, DNA/RNA-seq, variant calling, and Differential expression analyses.  

3. Statistics Applied to Genomics. Lasso and elastic-net regression, dimensionality reduction, path and heredity analysis.  

4. POST-GWAS. This also looks quite interesting, ranging from polygenic risk score and cross-validation, Meta-analysis of GWA studies to Mendelian randomization and method of Omics integrations.  

5. Machine Learning. This covers supervised/unsupervised/deep learning applied to genomics.

### What Am I Expecting Out of This Degree? 
Let's close this off by looking at what's ahead. What will I get out of this program? Well, too early to tell but if I were to guess, I'd say that at least I should be a statistical ninja. Hope's that statistical skills will be sound and crystal clear. Also, I do think that statistics involves a lot of critical thinking and pragmatic decision-making, and we don't ever have enough of that, to be honest. Too much no sense interpretation of data happens in many fields, almost as if they were just made on the spot, so we better off without all of that. 
I can't really tell what will happen during this time, I only know that it'll be fun.


And yeah, someone please give me a job, it's all fun and games until I can no longer pay for my snacks. Boy's hungry, boy gotta eat.

See ya.
