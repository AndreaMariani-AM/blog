      <description>All right, let&amp;rsquo;s cut to the chase, creating this Blog with RStudio, blogdown, and Hugo themes after just a week of introduction to R programming for my MSc&amp;rsquo;s program, was hella hard and a pain in the butt. I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna lie.
Most of the tutorials/how-to that you can find online, be it on video format or another person&amp;rsquo;s blog, are absolutely great; for them and for their settings and probably won&amp;rsquo;t transfer as well as you might think in your specific case.</description>
