      <description>We’re looking at nonlinear and noncontinuous models for regression in this post.
Let’s introduce CART and what that is. CART ’s an umbrella term that stands for Classification And Regression Tree and therefore comprises Classification Trees, used in another type of machine learning models (i.e. Classification), and Regression Tree used in Regression models.
We’ll talk about the latter in this post. A Regression Tree is one of the two Decision Trees used in data mining and machine learning and it’s used when the outcome/value we’re predicting is a continuous variable(not a “class” like the Classification one).</description>

      <description>In this post, we’ll talk about Simple Linear Regression and Polynomial Linear Regression. These two represent the backbone for linear and continuous regressions.
There’s also Multiple Linear Regression but it requires a small chat about model building, so it’ll be the content for a future post.
First things first, let’s dive deep into what is Regression. Regression can be defined as a set of statistical processes that are trying to estimate the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables, creating a model that best fits the data.</description>

      <title>Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning </title>

      <description>This post is based on the Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-on Python &amp;amp; R In Data Science course on Udemy that i’m taking. It’s a general introduction to the most used and known machine learning algorithms. This is the first chapter and a non-negotiable step not only for machine learning but also for every data analysis.
This’ll be a blend of concepts introduced in the course and other personal considerations to make it more complete.</description>
